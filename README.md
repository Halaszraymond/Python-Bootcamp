# Python-Bootcamp

Hey guys

Check out my portfolio from the Python Bootcamp that I followed!

The first days go back to the basics like inserting a print statement or asking for input aswell as making if statements and loops.
The projects get more difficult with the days increasing. Feel free to check them out.

Kind regards,

Raymond
